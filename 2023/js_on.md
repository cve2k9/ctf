## The Challenge

What we first run into by looking at this challenge is a website that allows you to run code with compiled `JS-ON` for an user.

There is also a 'bot' website that seems to run the user's generated code as admin.

Based on the code provided, the application is a web server that allows users to write JavaScript code and execute it on the server-side using a technology called JS-ON.

The server creates a unique identifier as a cookie for each user that connects to it, and saves the user's code and JS-ON payload in Redis. Users can retrieve their code and payload by specifying their unique identifier in the URL path.

There is also an admin feature that allows a user with a specific cookie to access a pre-defined library of JavaScript code with an embedded flag. However, this feature is protected by a cookie, which is checked against a predefined value that we can't access.
